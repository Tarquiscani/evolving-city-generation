This is not a complete video game, but just a demo of a procedural generation algorithm.

There are six different executables that allows you to run the game according to your PC performance. 
I suggest to run it in fullscreen mode to appreciate it fully, the windowed mode is provided just in case you experience any issue.

If you don't have a dedicated GPU, then go with low or medium quality executables. Otherwise it should run pretty well with high quality settings. 

=====================================================

** demo_fullscreen_low_quality.exe **
        Run the game in fullscreen mode at the lowest quality level. That means a small-size map and the anti-aliasing disabled.

** demo_fullscreen_medium_quality.exe **
        Run the game in fullscreen mode at the medium quality level. That means a medium-size map and the anti-aliasing disabled.

** demo_fullscreen_high_quality.exe **
        Run the game in fullscreen mode at the highest quality level. That means a very large map and the anti-aliasing enabled.
    
** demo_windowed_low_quality.exe **
        Run the game in windowed mode at the lowest quality level. That means a small-size map and the anti-aliasing disabled.

** demo_windowed_medium_quality.exe **
        Run the game in windowed mode at the medium quality level. That means a medium-size map and the anti-aliasing disabled.

** demo_windowed_high_quality.exe **
        Run the game in windowed mode at the highest quality level. That means a very large map and the anti-aliasing enabled.
